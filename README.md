Matt's Test Harness and test application

## Introduction

This is a demonstration test harness.  The goal of this test harness is to practice and demonstrate my ability to create a test harness from scratch.

See the issues list for a list of future enhancements.

## Running the tests

Set the python path to <repo-root>/python/

Run the tests using nosetest:

nosetests -sv python/qa/testapp/test/basic_test.py -m "^test_run_app"
